    <h3> Personal Website </h3>
    <ul>
      
    </ul>
    <p> The goal of this project was to construct a static website to host my personal projects and resume. I began by creating a Github repository and hosting a free page with Github pages using HTML and CSS. I realized that I wanted to automate some of the tedious steps in static site generation so I implemented Jekyll along with an open source theme.  After uploading the theme I added some customization using JavaScript and Devicon icons which you can see throughout the website along with some minor aesthetic fixes. Lastly, I purchased a custom domain and connected it via a DNS provider.</p>

    <h3> Python Trading Bot </h3>
    <ul>
    </ul>
    <p>The goal of this project was to construct a python bot that could day trade the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) in a profitable manner. I connected to the online brokerage Alpaca's API and utilized their paper trading features in Python.  I implemented an algorithm which utilizes the high-risk Martingdale system to buy and sell shares of SPY during trading hours to hopefully increase the overall portfolio value daily  </p>
